# Creator Insights Tracker

> A unified creator analytics dashboard that solves the "Which posts actually made me money?" problem.

## Overview

Creator Insights Tracker is a Whop app designed to help content creators understand the true ROI of their content across multiple platforms. Instead of juggling between different analytics dashboards, creators can see which specific posts, videos, or content pieces actually drove revenue, engagement, and conversions.

## The Problem We Solve

Creators today face a critical challenge: **they don't know which content actually makes them money**.

- You have 1,000 posts across Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok
- You have sales data from Whop, Gumroad, Stripe, and other platforms
- But which content piece drove which sale?
- Which type of content has the highest ROI?
- Should you make more tutorials or entertainment content?

**Creator Insights Tracker connects the dots** between your content and your revenue.

## Key Features

- **Unified Dashboard**: See all your content performance in one place
- **Revenue Attribution**: Track which posts/videos led to actual sales
- **Cross-Platform Analytics**: Connect Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, TikTok, and more
- **Engagement Metrics**: View likes, comments, shares, and saves alongside revenue data
- **Content ROI**: Understand which content types give you the best return on effort
- **Smart Insights**: Get AI-powered recommendations on what to create next
